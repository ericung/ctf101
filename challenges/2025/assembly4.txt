### Code:
```asm
0x133777000: call XxX
0x133777005: nop
0x133777006: xor rax, rax
0x133777009: push rax
0x13377700A: pop rdi
XxX:
0x13377700B: pop rax
```

### Explanation of Steps and Results:
1. **`0x133777000: call XxX`**:
   - **Action**: This transfers control to the address labeled `XxX` (`0x13377700B`), and it pushes the return address (`0x133777005`, the address of the next instruction) onto the stack.
   - **Result**: Execution jumps to `XxX`. The stack now contains `0x133777005`.

2. **`0x133777005: nop`**:
   - **Action**: No operation is performed. This is essentially a placeholder.
   - **Result**: The instruction is skipped with no changes to registers or memory.

3. **`0x133777006: xor rax, rax`**:
   - **Action**: Clears the `rax` register by performing a bitwise XOR operation on itself (`rax = 0`).
   - **Result**: The `rax` register is now set to `0`.

4. **`0x133777009: push rax`**:
   - **Action**: Pushes the value of `rax` (which is `0`) onto the stack.
   - **Result**: The stack now contains two values: `0x133777005` (return address from `call XxX`) and `0x0` (pushed value of `rax`).

5. **`0x13377700A: pop rdi`**:
   - **Action**: Pops the top value from the stack (which is `0x0`) and moves it into the `rdi` register.
   - **Result**: `rdi` now contains `0x0`, and the stack contains only one value: `0x133777005`.

6. **`XxX: 0x13377700B: pop rax`**:
   - **Action**: Pops the top value from the stack (which is `0x133777005`) and moves it into the `rax` register.
   - **Result**: `rax` now contains `0x133777005`, and the stack is empty.

---

### Final State:
- **Registers**:
  - `rax = 0x133777005` (return address from `call XxX`)
  - `rdi = 0x0` (value popped from the stack)
- **Stack**: Empty
